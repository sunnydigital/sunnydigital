- 👋 Hi, I’m @sunnydigital (Sunny Son 🌞)
- 👀 I’m interested in:
    - A whole lot!! WaoW!!
    - No, but in all seriousness Time Series Analysis, GANs, Computer Vision, Reinforcement (specifically Q) Learning, & NLP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
    - More niche aspects of PyTorch/Tensorflow and high-dimensional visualization methods (Plotly, and getting better at Seaborn)
- 📚 I'm currently reading:
    - Goedel, Escher, Bach: the Eternal Golden Braid
    - Touched with Fire
    - Time Series Analysis by Hamilton
    - The Principles of Deep Learning Theory by Roberts et al.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
    - Anything and everything interesting, really! I'm currently excited about NLP/NLU and CV w/ Deep NN's!
    - Telometry data collected from the Rockstar Games x NYU DSC Datathon with interesting features when applying k-NN Imputation & t-SNE Dimensionality Reduction
    - Utilization of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) **Risk** Data with a Fama-French Style Model to determine Fit & Accessibility by applying Time-Series Analysis
    - Determination of effects of sunshine on forest (tree) growth in metropolitan areas using CV & CG (through machine-learning imaging and computer-graphical modeling)
    - Understanding Ergodicity and the relationship it has with traffic flow (heuristic application of choice in Bounded Rationality)
- 📫 How to reach me:
    - By email! sunnys2327@gmail.com
